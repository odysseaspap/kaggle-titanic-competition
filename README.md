# Kaggle's Titanic Competition

This notebook includes my first approach to Kaggle's [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). In this challenge, the goal is to use passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc) and build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?”. 

To tackle this interesting problem, a preparatory analysis is performed and the best features are identified and used to build a classifier model.
